# GreenHack 2021: Waste Management 

## Problem Statement

## Solution 

### Dashboard (Technical) Details
The solution for detecting discrepancies between reports
generated by waste collectors and waste processors consists from two parts:
- Data processing pipeline
- Data analytics dashboard

#### Input data
- Waste collector reports exposed as Excel files, publicly available from [GreenHack official webpage](https://hackathon-tp-lj.squarespace.com/vec-o-izzivih#izziv_okolje).
- Waste processor reports exposed as Excel files  publicly available from [GreenHack official webpage](https://hackathon-tp-lj.squarespace.com/vec-o-izzivih#izziv_okolje).

#### Data processing pipeline
We developed a data processing pipeline as a Python service to perform Extraction, Transformation and Loading of the 
data into the final shape suitable for the analytics dashboard. The pipeline consists of several parts:
* Processing, verification and joining of table 5 from the collector report with table 2 from the processor report.
* Processing, verification and joining of table 5 from the collector report with table 2 from the collector report.
* Processing, verification and joining of table 4 from the processor report with table 2 from the processor report.
* Processing, verification and joining of table 4 from the processor report with table 2 from the collector report.

The processing service is located in the [repo's src](src/main.py).

#### Data analytics dashboard
To enable end users to easily explore the available data and perform discrepancy analyses we have developed an analytical application
using [QlikSense cloud](https://www.qlik.com/us/products/qlik-sense).
The application consists from two dashboards, an Executive dashboard that provides various high level KPIs and data visualization graphs for easier data understanding and exploration analyses.

The core of the application presents the dashboard that enables end users to check and control the discrepancies between amounts of waste collected and waste processed.

### Dashboard Demo
The analytical dashboard is publicly available at [QlikCloud tenant](https://y7re4jx3xts55u7.eu.qlikcloud.com/sense/app/85c95617-ef92-4767-8cb6-77120731060e/sheet/41807790-4e71-4a60-ab98-c08467a10fdd/state/analysis/hubUrl/%2Fexplore%2Fspaces%2Fall). 
In order to access the dashboard please login after being redirected to the login page with test account:
- email: hajduk.gojko@gmail.com
- pass: greenhack1!

Additionaly we have developed a simple web interface that exposes the graph visualizations from the Qlik Sense analytical application and shows
the abillity of the visualizatiotns being easily integrated within the preferred web page. The web interface is exposed at the [link](https://ghajduk3.github.io/greenhack2021/src/FrontEnd/table.html).
**NOTE**: Please login to the QlikCloud tenant as above described before accessing the web page.
